    :param exceptions: exceptions classes that will trigger another
        try. Other exceptions raised by the decorated function will
        not trigger a retry. The value of the exceptions parameters
        can be eiher an Exception or a tuple of Exception (actually,
        whatever is suitable for an except clause). The default is the
        Exception class, which means any error will trigger a new try.

    :param delay: the initial number of seconds to wait between two
        iterations. It must be non-negative. Default is 0.

    :param backoff: a multiplier applied to delay after each
        iteration. It can be a float, and it can actually be less than
        one. Default: 1 (no backoff).

    :param jitter: extra seconds added to delay between
        iterations. Default: 0.

    :param jitter: extra seconds added to delay between attempts. default: 0.
                   fixed if a number, random if a range tuple (min, max)
    :param max_delay: the maximum value of delay. default: None (no limit).

    :returns: a retry decorator for regular (non-coroutine) functions.
