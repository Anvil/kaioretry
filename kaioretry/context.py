    """The Retry Context will maintain the number of tries and the
    delay between those tries.

    It can act as both a Generator and an AsyncGenerator, and can be
    reused, multiple times, even with multiple Retry instances.

    The Retry objects will iterate over Context, synchronously, or
    asynchronously, depending of the nature of the decorated function.

    :param tries: the maxi number of iterations (a.k.a.: tries,
        function calls) to perform before exhaustion. A negative value
        means infinite. 0 is forbidden, since it would mean "don't
        run" at all.

    :param delay: the initial number of seconds to wait between two
        iterations. It must be non-negative. Default is 0 (no delay).

    :param backoff: a multiplier applied to the delay after each
        iteration. It can be a float, and it can actually be less than
        one. Default: 1 (no backoff).

    :param jitter: extra seconds added to delay between
        iterations. Default: 0.

    :param max_delay: the maximum value allowed for delay. If None
        (the default), then delay is unlimited. Cannot be negative.

    :param min_delay: the minimum value allowed for delay. Cannot be
        negative.
