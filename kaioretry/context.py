It's possible to insert delay between tries.

It will also log its actions and will help keep things being traceable by
adding a per-loop identifier to the logs. e.g:

   >>> from kaioretry import Context

If you consider this from :py:class:`~kaioretry.Retry` point of view, it means
that you can keep track of calls, delays and number of tries per calls.

If you want to do more fine tuning to delays and tries, check the

    :py:class:`~collections.abc.AsyncGenerator`, and can be reused,
    multiple times, even with multiple
    :py:class:`~kaioretry.retry.Retry` instances.

    :param tries: the maximum number of iterations (a.k.a.: tries,
        function calls) to perform before exhaustion. A negative value
        means infinite. 0 is forbidden, since it would mean "don't
        run" at all.

    :param delay: the initial number of seconds to wait between two
        iterations. It must be non-negative. Default is 0 (no delay).

    :param update_delay: a function that will produce the next value of delay
        value. Can be anything as long as it produces a positive number when
        called.

    :param max_delay: the maximum value allowed for delay. If None
        (the default), then delay is unlimited. Cannot be negative.

    :param min_delay: the minimum value allowed for delay. Cannot be
        negative. Default is 0.

    :param logger: the :py:class:`logging.Logger` object to which the
        log messages will be sent to.
